#Kitchen Sink

Kitchen Sink is a recipe site that allows you to filter recipes by ingredients, just like all the other ones out there. Where we differ is in offering you the option to blacklist ingredients.

Kitchen sink was built from the ground up over the course of four days using Angular.JS, and can be found live at:
